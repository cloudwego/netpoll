// Reader is a collection of operations for nocopy reads.
//
// For ease of use, it is recommended to implement Reader as a blocking interface,
// rather than simply fetching the buffer.
// For example, the return of calling Next(n) should be blocked if there are fewer than n bytes, unless timeout.
// The return value is guaranteed to meet the requirements or an error will be returned.
type Reader interface {
	// Next returns a slice containing the next n bytes from the buffer,
	// advancing the buffer as if the bytes had been returned by Read.
	//
	// If there are fewer than n bytes in the buffer, Next returns will be blocked
	// until data enough or an error occurs (such as a wait timeout).
	//
	// The slice p is only valid until the next call to the Release method.
	// Next is not globally optimal, and Skip, ReadString, ReadBinary methods
	// are recommended for specific scenarios.
	//
	// Return: len(p) must be n or 0, and p and error cannot be nil at the same time.
	Next(n int) (p []byte, err error)

	// Peek returns the next n bytes without advancing the reader.
	// Other behavior is the same as Next.
	Peek(n int) (buf []byte, err error)

	// Skip the next n bytes and advance the reader, which is
	// a faster implementation of Next when the next data is not used.
	Skip(n int) (err error)

	// Until reads until the first occurrence of delim in the input,
	// returning a slice stops with delim in the input buffer.
	// If Until encounters an error before finding a delimiter,
	// it returns all the data in the buffer and the error itself (often ErrEOF or ErrConnClosed).
	// Until returns err != nil only if line does not end in delim.
	Until(delim byte) (line []byte, err error)

	//
	// If you want to make a new Reader using the []byte returned by Next, Slice already does that,
	// and the operation is zero-copy. Besides, Slice would also Release this Reader.
	// The logic pseudocode is similar:
	//
	//  var p, err = this.Next(n)

	//  this.Release()
	//  return reader, err
	//

//  buf = append(buf[:0], ...)
//  Flush()
